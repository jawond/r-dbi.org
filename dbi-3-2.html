<h2>What is DBI?</h2>
<p>DBI stands for <strong>d</strong>ata<strong>b</strong>ase <strong>i</strong>nterface, and DBI is a package for connecting to database management systems (DBMS).
The goal of DBI is to provide a common interface for accessing a database, regardless of the specific underlying DBMS.</p>
<p>DBI works with a variety of DBMS, such as Postgres, MariaDB, and SQLite, allowing users to focus on the specifics of their project instead of setting up the infrastructure for data import and export.</p>
<p>The DBI package is perfect for anyone looking to connect to a database, read/write entire tables, and/or execute SQL queries.
DBI offers more control to the user than packages such as <a href="https://dbplyr.tidyverse.org/">{dbplyr}</a>.</p>
<p>DBI 1.1.0 has been released to CRAN a few days ago.</p>

<h2>What’s new with DBI?</h2>
<div id="specification-of-immediate-argument-to-dbsendquery-and-friends" class="section level3">
<h3>Specification of <code>immediate</code> argument to <code>dbSendQuery()</code> and friends</h3>
<p>It’s been noted that in MariaDB and SQL Server (when accessed through {odbc}), some statements cannot be executed as prepared statements.
Because DBI has historically used a prepared statement or query for everything, the <code>immediate</code> argument has been introduced, creating a direct query and thereby giving the user more control.</p>
<p>While the user may not need this feature often, it is important to note that it is backward compatible with default values and has already been implemented in the {odbc} package.</p>
<ul>
<li>Implementation in RMariaDB and RPostgres follows.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Examples using <code>immediate</code></strong></p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(DBI)
con &lt;- dbConnect(odbc::odbc(), dsn = &quot;SQLServerConnection&quot;)

# Isolate database updates:
# Did not work before, the transaction was terminated immediately.
dbExecute(con, &quot;BEGIN TRANSACTION&quot;, immediate = TRUE)
dbExecute(con, &quot;COMMIT TRANSACTION&quot;, immediate = TRUE)

# Create local temporary tables:
# Did not work before, temporary table was removed immediately.
dbExecute(con, &quot;CREATE TABLE #temp (a integer)&quot;, immediate = TRUE)
dbExecute(con, &quot;INSERT INTO #temp VALUES (1)&quot;, immediate = TRUE)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="driver-can-contain-connection-objects" class="section level3">
<h3>Driver can contain connection objects</h3>
<p>The existing method in DBI has been to create the driver object and then call <code>dbConnect()</code> with the connection arguments.
However there are times when a user may need to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Separate connection arguments from establishing a connection</li>
<li>Serialize the connector to file in order to establish the same connection later</li>
<li>Maintain multiple connectors in a list for testing different DBMS</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to address these use cases, users now have the ability to create a “connector object” that combines the driver and connection arguments, allowing the user to call <code>dbConnect()</code> without additional arguments.
This feature is both implemented in {DBI} and works out of the box for all DBI backends.</p>
<p>In addition, arguments can be functions, a useful feature for passwords.</p>
<ul>
<li>… and other sensitive connection data</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Examples of the driver containing connection objects</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>split this code chunk and insert clarifying text inbetween?</li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code>library(DBI)

# Old way:
drv &lt;- RSQLite::SQLite()
con &lt;- dbConnect(drv, dbname = &quot;:memory:&quot;)
dbDisconnect(con)

# New connector object:
cnr &lt;- new(&quot;DBIConnector&quot;,
  .drv = RSQLite::SQLite(),
  .conn_args = list(dbname = &quot;:memory:&quot;)
)
cnr</code></pre>
<pre><code>## &lt;DBIConnector&gt;&lt;SQLiteDriver&gt;
## Arguments:
## $dbname
## [1] &quot;:memory:&quot;</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>con &lt;- dbConnect(cnr)
dbDisconnect(con)

# Functions protect sensitive data:
my_path &lt;- function() &quot;:memory:&quot;
cnr &lt;- new(&quot;DBIConnector&quot;,
  .drv = RSQLite::SQLite(),
  .conn_args = list(dbname = function() my_path())
)

<div id="implementation-of-logging" class="section level3">
<h3>Implementation of logging</h3>
<p>When using applications in production, keeping logs is an invaluable part of a sound infrastructure.
As such, in spring 2019 I implemented logging for DBI and published it as a package called <a href="https://github.com/krlmlr/DBIlog">{DBIlog}</a>.
{DBIlog} is designed to be as simple as possible, and can be used as a standalone package or in conjunction with packages like {dplyr} and {dbplyr}.</p>
<p>{DBIlog} helps both with troubleshooting as well as auditing the queries that that are used to access a database.
Similar to Perl’s DBI::log, the goal of {DBIlog} is to implement logging for arbitrary DBI backends.</p>
<p>{DBIlog} is straightforward in its use, and starts by initializing a logging driver using <code>LoggingDBI()</code> prior to connecting to a database management system.
Following the initiation of a logging driver, all calls to DBI methods are logged and by default printed to the console (or redirected to a file).
The entirety of the logging output is runnable R code, so users can copy, paste, and execute the logging code as part of the debugging process.</p>
<p>Oftentimes DBI is used under the hood by other packages like <a href="https://dbplyr.tidyverse.org/">dbplyr</a> or <a href="https://tidymodels.github.io/tidypredict/">tidypredict</a>.
For example, because functions like <code>dplyr::src_dbi()</code> work with underlying DBI operations, {DBIlog} will also work in these scenarios.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Can we do one line per sentence, please?</p></li>
<li><p>I’ll rename the package to {dblog}.</p></li>
<li><p>Can you use/adapt a few examples from the dblog README?</p></li>
